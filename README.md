# Noether Networks: meta-learning useful conserved quantities

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce experiments from "Noether Networks:
meta-learning useful conserved quantities."
Noether Networks meta-learn inductive biases in the form of useful conserved quantities.
For details on the method, check out our NeurIPS 2021 paper, linked on our
[project website](https://dylandoblar.github.io/noether-networks/).

For instructions on how to train and evaluate a Noether Network for video prediction, check out
[`video_prediction/README.md`](video_prediction).
